        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="About"> I'm Angst Gregory, a dedicated and ambitious individual currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With an Associate's degree in Business Management already under my belt, I bring a unique blend of business acumen and technical expertise to the table. When I'm not buried in my studies or working on coding projects, I enjoy watching baseball, playing video games, and spending quality time with friends. My favorite game to unwind with is Valorant, but I'm always open to exploring new titles and experiences.
            </p>
            
            <p class="About">
            My ultimate goal is to become a proficient software developer or engineer. I aspire to earn enough to self-sustain and eventually work my way up to a comfortable living. My passion lies in creating solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also provide meaningful value to users. I believe in the power of technology to transform ideas into reality, and I'm excited to be part of that transformation.
            </p>

            <p class="About">
            Whether it's developing web applications, working on data analysis, or exploring new programming languages, I approach every challenge with curiosity and determination. I'm particularly interested in full-stack development and the intersection of business strategy and technology implementation.
            </p>
